**Philipp Pitchford**
Self-employed creator


My name is Philipp. I'm a self-employed creator from California.

I'm interested in how emergent technologies shape how we perceive and interact with ourselves and our communities.
More broadly I'm interested in art, design, health, language, systems, and the natural world.
I enjoy thinking and writing about these topics, and more, so [email me](mailto:philipp@hey.com) if you ever want to talk through them.

Most recently, I opened *[redacted]*, a studio offering yoga flow and yoga sculpt classes in my community. 
Before that, I led data product management at [Bank OZK](www.ozk.com), consulted at [Productive Edge](https://www.productiveedge.com), and built products to support public, nonprofit, and for profit educational ventures.
Once upon a time, I studied global management at [Thunderbird](https://thunderbird.asu.edu) and Russian Language at [Baylor](https://www.baylor.edu).
