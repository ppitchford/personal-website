Welcome to the source code of my personal website hosted here on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). 
This site is a dedicated portal where I share my work, experience, ideas, interests, and thoughts. 
The project represents the culmination of many years of desire to have a (digital) place of my own, and about one day of devoted work to make it possible. 
The initial design is just a single info page about myself using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) framework. 
I plan to (eventually) replace this with a more complete solution built from the ground up as I continue to learn the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev).

For now, I will continue to add content to this site. 
Thanks for stopping by! 👋
